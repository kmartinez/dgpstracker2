Computer Science dissertation project by Emily James
University of SOuthampton, April 2021
pyb - files that should be flashed or copied onto the microcontrollers
client - code run separately on a PC

More advanced version of picogps project - using ublox dGPS and a pyboard with lcd screen for local checks/config.

We will be using docstring to properly document each section of code better optimisation and future development & 
reference.

Any general modifications will be made through using Visual Studio Code connected directly to the board. 
These changes will then be copied over to this working repository for better reference.
